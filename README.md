# Python Algorithms and Data Structures

The purpose of this repository is to sharpen my Python skills and practice core principles in OOP, algorithms and data structures.  I intend to use plenty of documentation, unit testing and make the code as flexible as possible so as to be useful for multiple purposes in the future.

## Getting Started

You can simply clone this repository and work with it.  I do not have any code to compile with Cython, docker files or anything like that.

### Prerequisites

While this code is going to be put together with Python3 standards, there is a high probability that most, if not all, will be able to run on Python2.  Note that any executable scripts will have python in the shebang line, so that may need to be changed to python3 or py for you.

```
i.e. #! /usr/bin/env python
```

Note that I ensured I was using the correct latin abbreviation for the above: (https://www.grammarly.com/blog/know-your-latin-i-e-vs-e-g/)

### Installing

If you have git on your local machine, navigate to the location you want the root directory to be stored in and type:

```
git clone https://github.com/dpmcgonigle/python-algorithms-and-data-structs.git
```

If you don't have git, you can click the download zip button in the top right-hand corner.

## Running the tests

Once I integrate some unit tests, I will be putting instructions in this section.

### End to end tests

To be filled out later

```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
